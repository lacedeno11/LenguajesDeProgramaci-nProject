- She notes the target value: `target = 7`

**User Actions**:
```
1. Select text tool from toolbar
2. Tap on canvas to create text element
3. Type: "Find target value 7 in sorted array [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]"
4. Switch to pen tool
5. Draw array visualization with indices
```

**System Response**:
- Creates text element with timestamp and position
- Stores text content in Redux state
- Renders text on canvas with specified styling
- Switches active tool to pen
- Tracks drawing strokes as user sketches array

#### Phase 2: Initial Problem-Solving Attempt

## Six-Level Help System

The AI assistance system provides progressive help through six distinct levels, each designed to provide appropriate guidance without revealing solutions directly.

### Level 1: "I am stuck" - General Encouragement and Direction

**Purpose**: Provide emotional support and general direction without specific hints
**Timing**: When user first requests help or feels overwhelmed
**AI Behavior**: 
- Acknowledges user's current progress
- Provides encouragement and confidence building
- Offers general direction without specific solutions
- Asks broad, thought-provoking questions

**Example Responses**:
```
"I can see you're making good progress on this algorithm! You've identified the key components. Sometimes when we feel stuck, it helps to step back and think about the bigger picture. What is this algorithm trying to accomplish?"

"You're on the right track! The approach you're taking shows good algorithmic thinking. When you feel stuck, try asking yourself: what would happen if I traced through this step by step with a simple example?"
```

**User Experience**:
- Feels supported and encouraged
- Gains confidence to continue working
- Receives gentle nudge toward productive thinking
- No specific technical details revealed

### Level 2: "I need a hint" - Specific Guidance on Next Steps

**Purpose**: Provide targeted hints about the immediate next step
**Timing**: When user has made some progress but needs direction
**AI Behavior**:
- Analyzes current canvas content for context
- Identifies the specific area where user is stuck
- Provides focused hint about the next logical step
- Uses guiding questions to promote discovery

**Example Responses**:
```
"Looking at your drawing, I can see you understand the basic structure. The key insight you're looking for involves the relationship between your left and right pointers. What happens to the search space with each iteration?"

"You've correctly identified the need for a loop. Now think about this: under what condition should the loop continue? What does it mean when there's no more space to search?"
```

**User Experience**:
- Receives specific direction without solution
- Understands what to focus on next
- Maintains ownership of problem-solving process
- Feels guided but not given answers

### Level 3: "Show me an example" - Related Problem Examples

**Purpose**: Demonstrate concepts through guided examples
**Timing**: When user understands hints but needs to see application
**AI Behavior**:
- Provides step-by-step walkthrough of similar problem
- Uses different data than user's current problem
- Explains reasoning at each step
- Connects example back to user's specific case

**Example Responses**:
```
"Let's trace through a similar example together. Consider the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] and we're looking for 7:

Step 1: left=0, right=4, mid=2, array[2]=6
Since 6 < 7, we search the right half...

Step 2: left=3, right=4, mid=3, array[3]=8  
Since 8 > 7, we search the left half...

Step 3: left=3, right=2
Notice that left > right now. What does this tell us?"
```

**User Experience**:
- Sees concept applied in concrete example
- Understands the step-by-step reasoning
- Can apply similar logic to their own problem
- Gains confidence through guided demonstration

### Level 4: "Explain this concept" - Theoretical Background

**Purpose**: Provide deeper conceptual understanding
**Timing**: When user needs theoretical foundation
**AI Behavior**:
- Explains underlying principles and theory
- Connects current problem to broader concepts
- Provides context about why approach works
- Relates to real-world applications

**Example Responses**:
```
"Binary search is based on the divide-and-conquer principle. The key insight is that by comparing with the middle element, we can eliminate half of the remaining search space with each comparison.

This works because the array is sorted - if the target is smaller than the middle element, it can only be in the left half. This logarithmic reduction is why binary search is O(log n) instead of O(n) for linear search.

The termination condition (left > right) represents the mathematical concept of an empty search space - when there are no more elements to examine."
```

**User Experience**:
- Gains deeper understanding of underlying principles
- Connects current problem to broader computer science concepts
- Understands the "why" behind the approach
- Builds foundation for tackling similar problems

### Level 5: "Check my work" - Solution Validation

**Purpose**: Validate user's solution and provide feedback
**Timing**: When user believes they have a complete solution
**AI Behavior**:
- Analyzes user's complete solution
- Identifies correct and incorrect elements
- Provides specific feedback on implementation
- Suggests improvements or edge cases to consider

**Example Responses**:
```
"Great work! Let me review your solution:

‚úÖ Correct: Your loop condition 'while (left <= right)' is perfect
‚úÖ Correct: Midpoint calculation and comparison logic
‚úÖ Correct: Updating left and right pointers appropriately
‚úÖ Correct: Returning -1 when element not found

üí° Consider: What happens with integer overflow in (left + right) / 2 for very large arrays? The expression left + (right - left) / 2 is safer.

üí° Edge case: Your solution handles empty arrays correctly by immediately returning -1."
```

**User Experience**:
- Receives validation of correct understanding
- Learns about edge cases and optimizations
- Gains confidence in solution quality
- Understands areas for improvement

### Level 6: "What's wrong?" - Error Identification and Correction

**Purpose**: Help identify and fix specific errors
**Timing**: When user's solution has bugs or logical errors
**AI Behavior**:
- Identifies specific errors in logic or implementation
- Explains why the error occurs
- Guides toward correct solution without giving it directly
- Helps develop debugging skills

**Example Responses**:
```
"I notice an issue in your loop condition. You wrote 'while (left < right)' but this will miss the case where the target is at the position where left equals right.

Think about it: if left = right = 3, and array[3] is your target, your current condition would skip checking that position.

Try tracing through your algorithm with the array [5] and target 5. What happens with your current condition versus 'while (left <= right)'?"
```

**User Experience**:
- Learns to identify and fix bugs systematically
- Understands the reasoning behind corrections
- Develops debugging and testing mindset
- Maintains problem-solving ownership

  'stroke_completed',    // After each drawing stroke
  'text_added',         // After adding text elements
  'ai_interaction',     // After each AI help request
  'tool_changed',       // When switching tools
  'view_changed'        // When zooming or panning
];

// Save frequency
const saveConfig = {
  immediate: ['ai_interaction', 'text_added'],
  debounced: ['stroke_completed', 'view_changed'], // 2 second delay
  periodic: 30000 // Every 30 seconds regardless
};
```

    if (!stroke.id || !stroke.points || stroke.points.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('Invalid stroke structure');
    }
    
    // Validate point data
    stroke.points.forEach(point => {
      if (typeof point.x !== 'number' || typeof point.y !== 'number') {
        throw new Error('Invalid point coordinates');
      }
    });
    
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    // Attempt recovery
    const recoveredStroke = attemptStrokeRecovery(stroke);
    if (recoveredStroke) {
      logWarning('Stroke data recovered', { originalStroke: stroke, recovered: recoveredStroke });
      return recoveredStroke;
    }
    
    // If recovery fails, remove corrupted stroke
    logError('Corrupted stroke removed', { stroke });
    return null;
  }
};
```

        action: () => exportCurrentSession()
      },
      {
        text: 'Continue without saving',
        action: () => enableTemporaryMode(),
        warning: 'Your work will not be saved'
      }
    ]
  });
};
```

**6. Session Corruption During Load**

**Scenario**: Saved session data is corrupted and cannot be loaded

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
const handleCorruptedSession = (sessionId: string, error: Error) => {
  // Attempt recovery from checkpoints
  const checkpoints = getSessionCheckpoints(sessionId);
  
  if (checkpoints.length > 0) {
    const latestCheckpoint = checkpoints[checkpoints.length - 1];
    
    showDialog({
      title: 'Session Recovery',
      message: `Your session data was corrupted, but we found a backup from ${formatTime(latestCheckpoint.timestamp)}. Would you like to restore from this backup?`,
      options: [
        {
          text: 'Restore from backup',
          action: () => loadFromCheckpoint(latestCheckpoint)
        },
        {
          text: 'Start new session',
          action: () => createNewSession()
        }
      ]
    });
  } else {
    // No recovery possible
    showDialog({
      title: 'Session Cannot Be Recovered',
      message: 'Unfortunately, this session data is corrupted and cannot be recovered. You can start a new session.',
      options: [
        {
          text: 'Start New Session',
          action: () => createNewSession()
        }
      ]
    });
  }
};
```

**User Experience**:
- Automatic recovery attempts
- Clear communication about data status
- Options for continuing work
- Prevention of complete data loss when possible

### Network and Connectivity Errors

**7. Intermittent Network Connectivity**

**Scenario**: Network connection is unstable during AI interactions

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
const handleNetworkInstability = () => {
  let retryCount = 0;
  const maxRetries = 3;
  
  const retryWithBackoff = async (request: AIRequest) => {
    try {
      return await callAIService(request);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.type === 'NETWORK_ERROR' && retryCount < maxRetries) {
        retryCount++;
        const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
        
        showNotification({
          type: 'info',
          message: `Network issue detected. Retrying in ${delay/1000} seconds... (${retryCount}/${maxRetries})`
        });
        
        await sleep(delay);
        return retryWithBackoff(request);
      }
      
      throw error;
    }
  };
  
  return retryWithBackoff;
};
```
