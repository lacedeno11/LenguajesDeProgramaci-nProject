## Project Overview

**SL8.ai** is a revolutionary intelligent digital whiteboard specifically designed to enhance algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills. Unlike traditional educational tools that provide direct answers, SL8.ai acts as an AI-powered tutor that guides users through the reasoning process, fostering critical thinking and deep understanding of algorithmic concepts.

The platform transforms the way students and programmers approach complex problems by providing contextual hints, step-by-step guidance, and intelligent feedback without revealing solutions directly. This approach encourages users to develop their own problem-solving methodologies while building confidence in their analytical abilities.

### Core Philosophy

SL8.ai operates on the principle that **learning happens through guided discovery, not direct instruction**. Our AI tutor understands when users are stuck and provides just enough guidance to help them move forward while maintaining ownership of their learning journey.
